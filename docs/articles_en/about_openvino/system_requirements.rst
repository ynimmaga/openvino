System Requirements
===================
 


Certain hardware requires specific drivers to work properly with OpenVINO. 
These drivers, including Linux* kernels, might require updates to your operating system,
which is not part of OpenVINO installation. Refer to your hardware's documentation 
for updating instructions.

   .. tab-item::  Supported Hardware

      * Intel® HD Graphics
      * Intel® UHD Graphics
      * Intel® Iris® Pro Graphics
      * Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics
      * Intel® Iris® Xe Max Graphics
      * Intel® Arc ™ GPU Series
      * Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series
      * Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series

   .. tab-item::  Supported Operating Systems

      * Ubuntu 22.04 long-term support (LTS), 64-bit
      * Ubuntu 20.04 long-term support (LTS), 64-bit
      * Windows 10, 64-bit
      * Windows 11, 64-bit
      * Centos 7
      * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 64-bit

   .. tab-item:: Additional considerations

      * The use of of GPU requires drivers that are not included in the Intel®
        Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package.
      * A chipset that supports processor graphics is required for Intel® Xeon®
        processors. Processor graphics are not included in all processors. See
        `Product Specifications  <https://ark.intel.com/>`__ 
        for information about your processor.  
      * Although this release works with Ubuntu 20.04 for discrete graphic cards,
        Ubuntu 20.04 is not POR for discrete graphics drivers, so OpenVINO support
        is limited.  
      * The following minimum (i.e., used for old hardware) OpenCL™ driver's versions
        were used during OpenVINO internal validation: 22.43 for Ubuntu 22.04, 21.48
        for Ubuntu 20.04 and 21.49 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

.. note::

   OpenVINO Python binaries and binaries on Windows/CentOS7/MACOS(x86) are built
   with oneTBB libraries. Other binaries on Ubuntu and Redhat OSes are built with
   legacy TBB which is released by OS distribution. OpenVINO can be built with 
   either oneTBB or legacy TBB by the user on all OS systems listed. System 
   compatibility and performance are improved on Hybrid CPUs, 
   such as 12th Gen Intel Core and above.
