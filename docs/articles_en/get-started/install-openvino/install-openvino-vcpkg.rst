Install OpenVINO™ Runtime via vcpkg
=====================================

   :description: Learn how to install OpenVINO™ Runtime on Windows, Linux, and macOS
                 operating systems, using vcpkg.

.. note::

   Note that the vcpkg distribution:

   * offers C/C++ API only
   * does not offer support for NPU inference
   * is dedicated to users of all major OSes: Windows, Linux, and macOS
     (all x86_64 / arm64 architectures)

Installing OpenVINO Runtime
###########################

1. Make sure that you have installed vcpkg on your system. If not, follow the
   `vcpkg installation instructions <https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started>`__.


2. Install OpenVINO using the following terminal command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      vcpkg install openvino

   vcpkg also enables you to install only selected components, by specifying them in the command.
   See the list of `available features <https://vcpkg.link/ports/openvino>`__, for example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      vcpkg install 'openvino[core,cpu,ir]'

   vcpkg also provides a way to install OpenVINO for any specific configuration you want via `triplets <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/users/triplets>`__, for example to install OpenVINO statically on Windows, use:

   .. code-block:: sh

      vcpkg install 'openvino:x64-windows-static'

Note that the vcpkg installation means building all packages and dependencies from source,
which means the compiler stage will require additional time to complete the process.

After installation, you can use OpenVINO in your product's cmake scripts:

.. code-block:: sh

   find_package(OpenVINO REQUIRED)

And running from terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

   cmake -B <build dir> -S <source dir> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

Congratulations! You've just Installed and used OpenVINO in your project! For some use cases you may still
need to install additional components. Check the
:doc:`list of additional configurations <../configurations>`
to see if your case needs any of them.
