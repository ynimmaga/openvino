Object detection and masking from prompts with GroundedSAM (GroundingDINO + SAM) and OpenVINO
=============================================================================================

In this notebook, we provide the OpenVINOâ„¢ optimization for the
combination of GroundingDINO + SAM =
`GroundedSAM <https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything>`__
on IntelÂ® platforms.

GroundedSAM aims to detect and segment anything with text inputs.
GroundingDINO is a language-guided query selection module to enhance
object detection using input text. It selects relevant features from
image and text inputs and returns predicted boxes with detections. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) produces high quality object masks from
input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate
masks for all objects in an image. We use box predictions from
GroundingDINO to mask the original image.

More details about the model can be found in the
`paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14159>`__, and the official
`repository <https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything>`__.

For faster computation and to limit RAM by default we use
``EfficientSAM`` for segmentation, but if you wish more accurate
segmentation you can select vanilla ``SAM``.

Great! All clouds and horses are detected. Feel free to play around and
specify other objects you wish to detect.

Convert SAM to OpenVINO IR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



And now letâ€™s feed those detection to ``SAM`` model. We will use
``EfficiendSAM`` for faster computation and to save ram, but feel free
to select vanilla ``SAM`` if you wish more detailed and precise
segmentation. First of all letâ€™s convert ``SAM`` model to OpenVINO IR.

    if not ov_efficient_sam_path.exists() and use_efficient_sam:
        random_input_image = np.random.rand(1, 3, *pil_image.size[::-1]).astype(np.float32)
        bounding_box = np.array([900, 100, 1000, 200]).reshape([1, 1, 2, 2])
        bbox_labels = np.array([2, 3]).reshape([1, 1, 2])

Run SAM model for the same image with the detected boxes from
GroundingDINO.

Please note that vanilla SAM and EfficientSAM have slightly different
detection formats. But inputs for both of them originate from
``boxes_filt`` which is result of the ``get_ov_grounding_output``. For
EfficientSAM we use ``detections.xyxy`` boxes obtained after
``boxes_filt`` is fed to ``Model.post_process_result``. While vanilla
SAM has itâ€™s own preprocessing function ``transform_boxes``.

.. code:: ipython3

    if use_efficient_sam:
        masks = predict_efficient_sam_masks(compiled_efficient_sam, pil_image, detections.xyxy)
        detections.mask = masks.numpy()
    else:
        transformed_boxes = transform_boxes(sam_predictor, boxes_filt, pil_image.size[::-1])
        masks = predict_vanilla_sam_masks(compiled_vanilla_sam, np.array(pil_image), transformed_boxes)
        detections.mask = masks[:, 0].numpy()

Combine both boxes and segmentation masks and draw them.
