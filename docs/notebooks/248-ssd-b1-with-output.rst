Image generation with Segmind Stable Diffusion 1B (SSD-1B) model and OpenVINO
=============================================================================

The `Segmind Stable Diffusion Model
(SSD-1B) <https://github.com/segmind/SSD-1B?ref=blog.segmind.com>`__ is
a distilled 50% smaller version of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL),
offering a 60% speedup while maintaining high-quality text-to-image
generation capabilities. It has been trained on diverse datasets,
including Grit and Midjourney scrape data, to enhance its ability to
create a wide range of visual content based on textual prompts. This
model employs a knowledge distillation strategy, where it leverages the
teachings of several expert models in succession, including SDXL,
ZavyChromaXL, and JuggernautXL, to combine their strengths and produce
impressive visual outputs.

In this tutorial, we consider how to run the SSD-1B model using
OpenVINO.

We will use a pre-trained model from the `Hugging Face
Diffusers <https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index>`__ library. To
simplify the user experience, the `Hugging Face Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index>`__ library is
used to convert the models to OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format.

SSD-1B Base model 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will start with the base model part, which is responsible for the
generation of images of the desired output size.
`SSD-1B <https://huggingface.co/segmind/SSD-1B>`__ is available for
downloading via the `HuggingFace hub <https://huggingface.co/models>`__.
It already provides a ready-to-use model in OpenVINO format compatible
with `Optimum
Intel <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/index>`__.

To load an OpenVINO model and run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime,
you need to replace diffusers ``StableDiffusionXLPipeline`` with Optimum
``OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline``. In case you want to load a PyTorch
model and convert it to the OpenVINO format on the fly, you can set
``export=True``.

You can save the model on disk using the ``save_pretrained`` method.

.. code:: ipython3

    from pathlib import Path
    from optimum.intel.openvino import OVStableDiffusionXLPipeline
    
    
    model_id = "segmind/SSD-1B"
    model_dir = Path("openvino-ssd-1b")

Run Text2Image generation pipeline 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, we can run the model for the generation of images using text
prompts. To speed up evaluation and reduce the required memory we
decrease ``num_inference_steps`` and image size (using ``height`` and
``width``). You can modify them to suit your needs and depend on the
target hardware. We also specified a ``generator`` parameter based on a
numpy random state with a specific seed for results reproducibility.
>\ **Note**: Generating a default size 1024x1024 image requires about
53GB for the SSD-1B model in case if the converted model is loaded from
disk and up to 64GB RAM for the SDXL model after exporting.
