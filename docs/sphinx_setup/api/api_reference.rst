OpenVINO toolkit offers **APIs for Python, C, and C++** which share most features (C++ being the
most comprehensive one), have a common structure, naming convention styles, namespaces,
and no duplicate structures.

OpenVINO API 2.0 may be described by the following:

- Preserves input element types and order of dimensions (layouts), and stores tensor names from the
  original models (Model Conversion API).
- Uses tensor names for addressing, which is the standard approach among the compatible model
  frameworks.
- Can address input and output tensors by the index. Some model formats like ONNX are sensitive
  to the input and output order, which is preserved by OpenVINO.
- Includes :doc:`properties <../openvino_docs_OV_UG_query_api>`, unifying metrics and configuration key concepts.
  The main advantage is that they have the C++ type: ``static constexpr Property<std::string> full_name{"FULL_DEVICE_NAME"};``
